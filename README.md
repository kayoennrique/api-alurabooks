# JSONServer + JWT Auth

This is a mocked Rest API, using json-server and JWT.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run start-auth
```
## üõ†Ô∏è How to register?

You can do this by making a post request to:

```
POST http://localhost:8000/public/registrar
```

With the following data:


```
{
    "name": "kayo ennrique",
    "email": "kayo.ennrique@hotmail.com.br",
    "password": "123456",
    "address": "Rua Vergueiro, 3185",
    "complement": "Vila Mariana",
    "cep": "04101-300"
}
```

Note that email is a unique field and users with duplicate emails will not be persisted.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to log in?

You can do this by making a post request to:

```
POST http://localhost:8000/public/login
```

With the following data:


```
{
  "email": "kayo.ennrique@hotmail.com.br",
  "password":"123456"
}
```

You will receive a token in the following format:

```
{
   "access_token": "<ACCESS_TOKEN>",
   "user": { ... dados do usu√°rio ... }
}
```

## Authenticate upcoming requests?

And then, add this same token to the header of the next requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>
```
